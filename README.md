# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this analysis was to create databases from various movies throughout the years and perform various tasks on them to change certain information and to clean, edit, and remove unnecessary data.  I then had to load the clean data back into tables and data frames.  I had to create a function to show the changes that were made.   The refactored code created new databases.
